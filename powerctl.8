powerctl - control power management states
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBpowerctl\fR [-qDIM] <desired state>
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBpowerctl\fR is a tool which manages power states on Linux.\& Users of this tool
must be root or a member of the "power" group.\& When run with no options, it sets
the system'\&s sleep state to the specified state, which causes the system to
immediately enter a sleep state (e.\&g.\& suspend).\& The -D, -I, and -M options
configure the system'\&s sleep states and behavior.\& The -q option takes no
argument and prints the current system sleep configuration, and does not require
root access or membership in the power group.\&
.P
.SH USAGE
.P
\fBpowerctl\fR <disk|freeze|standby|mem>
.RS 4
When executed with no options, the specified sleep state is entered,
immediately putting the system into some level of suspension.\& The
options have the following meanings:
.P
\fBdisk\fR
.RS 4
Enter the "hibernation" state.\& A system memory image is written
to disk and the system enters the state associated with the
\fIdisk\fR configuration (see \fBpowerctl -D\fR).\&
.P
.RE
\fBfreeze\fR
.RS 4
Enter the "suspend to idle" state, a software-supported
low-power state which is always supported but achieves the worst
power performance.\&
.P
.RE
\fBstandby\fR
.RS 4
Enter the "standby" state, in which more system resources are
powered down or placed into a low-power mode than s2idle.\& This
offers improved power savings over \fBs2idle\fR, but increases
system resume latency.\&
.P
.RE
\fBmem\fR
.RS 4
Enter the \fImem\fR state (see \fBpowerctl -M\fR).\&
.P
.RE
.RE
\fBpowerctl -q\fR
.RS 4
Query the current system power management configuration and supported
options, and print them to stdout.\& This operation does not require
elevated permissions.\&
.P
.RE
\fBpowerctl -D\fR <platform|shutdown|reboot|suspend|test_resume>
.RS 4
Configures the behavior following a suspend-to-disk operation.\& The
options have the following meanings:
.P
\fBplatform\fR
.RS 4
Enter the platform-specific suspended state, if supported, e.\&g.\&
ACPI S4.\&
.P
.RE
\fBshutdown\fR
.RS 4
Power off the system.\&
.P
.RE
\fBreboot\fR
.RS 4
Reboot the system.\& Useful for diagnostics and testing.\&
.P
.RE
\fBsuspend\fR
.RS 4
Enter the "hybrid" suspend mode.\& This state enters the sleep
mode specified by the \fImem\fR state, then, if the system
successfully wakes up from this state, the hibernation state is
discarded.\& Otherwise, the system resumes as if from the normal
hibernation state.\&
.P
.RE
\fBtest_resume\fR
.RS 4
Immediately resume from the hibernation state and perform a full
system resume.\& Useful for diagnostics and testing.\&
.P
.RE
.RE
\fBpowerctl -I\fR <size in bytes>
.RS 4
Configure the desired maximum hibernation image size.\& The kernel
interprets this value as a best-effort target, and, if necessary, a
larger image will be produced.\& Setting this value to zero will always
produce the smallest possible image.\&
.P
.RE
\fBpowerctl -M\fR <s2idle|shallow|deep>
.RS 4
Configures the desired system suspend behavior for the \fImem\fR state.\& The
options have the following meanings:
.P
\fBs2idle\fR
.RS 4
Use the "suspend to idle" state, a software-supported low-power
state which is always supported but achieves the worst power
performance.\&
.P
.RE
\fBshallow\fR
.RS 4
Use the "standby" state, in which more system resources are
powered down or placed into a low-power mode than s2idle.\& This
offers improved power savings over \fBs2idle\fR, but increases
system resume latency.\&
.P
.RE
\fBdeep\fR
.RS 4
Use the "suspend to RAM" state, in which all system resources
are powered off except for RAM.\& This mode offers the best power
savings among these options, but has the highest resume latency
and requires re-initializing all I/O devices.\&
